For example, in a housing dataset, features might include:\\nNumber of bedrooms\\nSquare footage\\nLocation\\nAge of the house\\nLabel\\nLabel(also called target) is the output — the value you're trying to predict. In the housing example, the label would be:\\nHouse price\\n🔧Training Data\\nThis is the data you use to build your model.\\nThe model learns patterns from this data.\\nExample: If you're predicting house prices, the training data includes houses with known prices.\\n🧪Testing Data\\nThis is new data the model hasn’t seen before.\\nYou use it to evaluate how well your model performs.\\nIt helps you check if the model can make accurate predictions on unseen data.\\n👉 Think of it like studying for an exam:\\nTraining data = practice questions\\nTesting data = actual exam questions\\n🎯 Overfitting\\nThe model learns too much from the training data — even the noise and random patterns.\\nIt performs very well on training data but poorly on testing data.\\nLike memorizing answers instead of understanding concepts.\\n💤 Underfitting\\nThe model is too simple to capture the patterns in the data.\\nIt performs poorly on both training and testing data.\\nLike not studying enough and guessing on the exam.\\nML Algorithm\\nAn algorithm is a set of rules or instructions for solving a problem.\\nIn machine learning, an algorithm is the method used to train a model.\\nExamples:\\nLinear regression algorithm, decision tree algorithm, logistic regression algorithm.\\nML Model\\nA model is the result you get after applying an algorithm to your data.\\nThe model is what you use to make predictions.\\nExample:\\nAfter training a decision tree algorithm on your housing data, you get a decision tree model that can predict house prices.\\nSimple Analogy\\nAlgorithm:\\nLike a recipe for baking a cake.\\nModel:\\nThe cake you get after following the recipe with your ingredients.\\nWhen We Say “Choosing the Right ML Model”\\nWe mean: Choosing the right type of model and the right algorithm to create it.\\nFor example, if you want to predict a number, you might choose a linear regression model (using the linear regression algorithm which we learn in coming posts!!).\\nIf you want to predict a category, you might choose a decision tree model (using the decision tree algorithm which we learn in coming posts!!).\\nYou choose an algorithm based on your problem and data.\\nThe trained model is what you use to make predictions.\\n🍿 That was the trailer — the next post’s the feature film.
